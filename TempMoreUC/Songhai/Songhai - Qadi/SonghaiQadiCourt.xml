			<Text>Criminal justice in Songhai was based mainly, if not entirely, on Islamic principles, especially during the rule of Askia Muhammad. The local qadis were tasked with maintaining order by following Sharia law, found in the precepts of the Qur'an and the hadiths. Kings usually did not judge a defendant, however, under special circumstances, such as acts of treason, they felt an obligation to do so and thus exert their authority. Results of a trial were announced by the "town crier" and punishment for most trivial crimes usually consisted of confiscation of merchandise or imprisonment.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			Askia Muhammad centralized the administration of the empire and established an efficient bureaucracy which was responsible for, among other things, tax collection and the administration of justice. Qadis worked at the local level and were positioned in important trading towns, such as Timbuktu and Djenne. The Qadi was appointed by the king and dealt with common-law misdemeanors according to Sharia law.</Text>
