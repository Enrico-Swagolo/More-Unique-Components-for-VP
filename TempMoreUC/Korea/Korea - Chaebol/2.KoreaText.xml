			<Text>Chaebol are powerful multi-national corporations originating in South Korea. Beginning as family businesses, they grew by recieving government investment and relief, and were able to industrialise South Korea's agricultural society. Although the Chaebol were signs of success during the Miracle of the Han River, financial crashes later in the 20th century led to many collapsing - an event that the Korean people thought impossible.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chaebols continue to dominate the South Korean economy and social fabric, and some like Samsung and Hyundai have become household names worldwide. Today, Chaebol account for over 80% of South Korea's exports, and the largest Chaebol controls 17% of the nation's GDP.</Text>
