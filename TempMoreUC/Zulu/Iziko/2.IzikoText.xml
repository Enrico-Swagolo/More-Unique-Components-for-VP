			<Text>An Iziko is a simple hearth used as a gathering place for Zulu communities. The fireplace is revered as a resource for food, warmth, dreams, and for communicating with ancestors. It is from these gatherings that a sense of community and identity was formed, and young Zulus could perform and bond.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
			The fireplace is used metaphorically for the "cooking of songs" in isicathamiya stage performances, a traditional, yet somewhat modern offshoot of traditional Zulu music. Dreams were an essential part of communicating with ancestors and formed part of a deeply rooted Zulu religion. Some isicathamiya musicians claim some of their songs were created in the spiritual realm given to them by ancestors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
