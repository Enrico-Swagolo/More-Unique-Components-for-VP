				Sambadrome (Samb√≥dromo in Portuguese language) is the name given to an exhibition place for the Samba schools parades during Carnaval in Brazil. A sambadrome generally consists of tiered spectator viewing areas surrounding a long alley for the schools to parade down.  The parades attract many thousands of Brazilians and foreign tourists each year.

				The Sambadrome is the unique Brazilian replacement for the Opera House. It provides more Culture than the Opera House, and it also provides Golden Age Points and Tourism, and comes with a Musician specialist slot.
